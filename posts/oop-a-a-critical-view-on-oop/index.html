<p>Imagine there had been a couple of people, somewhere buried in the past, that basically invented the complete foundation technologies for everything that continues to shape our reality and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Sounds like a cheesy creation myth? But it&rsquo;s not; it&rsquo;s actually what happened at Xerox PARC starting in the 1970th. Here&rsquo;s a list of some of the notable names from the early days of PARC:</p>
<ul>
<li>Butler W. Lampson (Turing Award)</li>
<li>Alan Kay (Turing Award)</li>
<li>Charles P. Thacker (Turing Award)</li>
<li>Mark Weiser (Ubiquitous Computing)</li>
<li>Lynn Conway (VLSI)</li>
<li>Adele Goldberg (Smalltalk)</li>
<li>Neil J. Gunther (PARCbench)</li>
<li>Daniel P. Huttenlocher (JBIG2)</li>
<li>Butler Lampson (Alto, laser printer, Ethernet, Bravo, Mesa)</li>
<li>Calvin Quate</li>
<li>Eric Schmidt</li>
<li>Charles Simonyi (Bravo)</li>
<li>Charles P. Thacker (Alto, Ethernet, laser printer)</li>
</ul>
<p>This are the actual people behind our modern technologies. :</p>
<ul>
<li>The Xerox Alto and 10 years later the Xerox Star, the first computer systems with graphical user interfaces</li>
<li>Ethernet networking</li>
<li>The first integrated programming environments &ndash; BCPL, LISP, Smalltalk , Mesa, and Poplar</li>
<li>Bravo and Gypsy &ndash; the first WYSIWYG word processors that inspired Microsoft™ Word™</li>
<li>Laurel, later Hardy &ndash; probably the networked E-mail clients</li>
<li>Markup and Draw—Painting and graphics manipulation (graphical bitmap editors)</li>
<li>Neptune — A graphical file manager</li>
<li>The first FTP and chat utilities</li>
<li>A couple of games — Chess, Pinball, Othello and a Alto Trek game by Gene Ball</li>
<li>Sil — A graphical vector graphics editor, used mainly for logic circuits, printed circuit</li>
<li>Officetalk — An experimental forms-processing system</li>
</ul>
<p>The sheer amount of innovations produced at PARC is breathtaking. Most of which formed the basis for the technological development that came afterwards. People like Steve Jobs and many Microsoft Managers harvested a whole life of business success from a couple of inspiring visits at PARC.</p>
<p>Adele Goldberg, Alan Kay, L. Peter Deutsch, Ronald Kaplan, Warren Teitelman, Dan Ingalls and Diana Merry where among the first people that took it to themselves to design a complete integrated development environments. What that means is that &ndash; for the first time &ndash; people actually got their hands dirty in programming in an object oriented way. They produced the full stack of tools required to do that.</p>
<h2 id="the-building-blocks-of-a-programming-system">The building blocks of a programming system</h2>
<ul>
<li>One of the first OO programming languages</li>
<li>Compilers, interpreters, just-in-time compilers</li>
<li>Runtime environments like virtual machines</li>
<li>Memory management and garbage collectors</li>
<li>High performance graphics systems (bit blit based back then)</li>
<li>And not forget: extensive libraries of expert-designed modules, that we now call class libraries</li>
</ul>
<p>And they went through the complete software life cycle with all of it. So their experiences covered the whole spectrum of trial, error and making it better the second time.</p>
<p>Al of this happened during the 1970th and 1980th, when we can observe a co-evolution of Smalltalk and Lisp based systems. On could they both areas co-inspired each other. Both developed their object systems with extensive class libraries, composed of all of the above mentioned building blocks. The people involved in software development during this time all experienced what it meant to prototype, maintain and extend big systems in object-oriented fashion. As early as the 1970th and early 80th. And what is kind of a surprise:</p>
<p><strong>They where wildly misunderstood and ignored, for decades to come! No-one cared to learn from them.</strong></p>
<h2 id="alan-kay-disapproves-of-what-became-of-object-orientation">Alan Kay disapproves of what became of object orientation</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a secret that the person who coined the term OO - Alan Kay - is not very happy about the concepts that over time happened to become associated with it.</p>
<h3 id="nowadays-object-orientation-means">Nowadays object orientation means:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Inheritance</li>
<li>Polymorphism</li>
<li>Encapsulation</li>
</ul>
<p>Whereas Alan Kay had the following principles in mind:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>I thought of objects being like biological cells and/or individual computers on a network, only able to communicate with messages (so messaging came at the very beginning &ndash; it took a while to see how to do messaging in a programming language efficiently enough to be useful).</li>
<li>I wanted to get rid of data. The B5000 almost did this via its almost unbelievable HW architecture. I realized that the cell/whole-computer metaphor would get rid of data, and that &ldquo;&lt;-&rdquo; would be just another message token (it took me quite a while to think this out because I really thought of all these symbols as names for functions and procedures.</li>
<li>My math background made me realize that each object could have several algebras associated with it, and there could be families of these, and that these would be very very useful. The term &ldquo;polymorphism&rdquo; was imposed much later (I think by Peter Wegner) and it isn&rsquo;t quite valid, since it really comes from the nomenclature of functions, and I wanted quite a bit more than functions. I made up a term &ldquo;genericity&rdquo; for dealing with generic behaviors in a quasi-algebraic form.</li>
<li>I didn&rsquo;t like the way Simula I or Simula 67 did inheritance (though I thought Nygaard and Dahl were just tremendous thinkers and designers). So I decided to leave out inheritance as a built-in feature until I understood it better.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alan Kay in a response to a question from Stefan Ram <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-does-Alan-Kay-consider-as-real-OOP">Source: Re: Clarification of &ldquo;object-oriented&rdquo;</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So what he actually meant are software design principles that actually help with simplifying program code and making it better understandable:</p>
<p>Designing software around <strong>decoupled subsystems</strong> that <strong>communicate via messages,</strong> are <strong>designed around behaviors</strong> and keep repetition low by using techniques that allow for <strong>generic expression of behavior.</strong></p>
<h3 id="so-what-kind-of-thing-is-this-object-orientation-actually">So what kind of thing is this &ldquo;object-orientation&rdquo; actually?</h3>
<p>If one looks at what object-orientation achieves at the end of the day, one could say that it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;nice wrapping paper to roll up algorithms and variables.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a set of <strong>ordering and design principles for program behavior to help reduce complexity.</strong> The aspects Alan Kay emphasizes might not look like much at first glance, but they get close to what is quite important to produce maintainable and reliable software. Something that the concepts &ldquo;inheritance&rdquo; and the 1990th-style of &ldquo;polymorphism&rdquo; we find in C++ and Java, somehow fail to improve in a meaningful way.</p>
<h2 id="why-did-the-meaning-of-oo-change">Why did the meaning of OO change?</h2>
<p>There are many different opinions about the reasons behind this change. Some people argue that Alan Kay&rsquo;s definition just wasn&rsquo;t what the market actually required, so it got replaced by something else. I don&rsquo;t agree with this and tend more towards the following.</p>
<p>Before the 70th computerization in businesses and corporations wasn&rsquo;t very high. During the 80th the corporate world suddenly began to grasp the potential of the technology and began to adopt it. Without caring at all about the opinions of the geniuses of the field. At the same time the micro-computer revolution happened and the market was flooded with cheap and underpowered computer hardware. While it&rsquo;s true, that only the price drop made the broad adoption possible, it also caused a complete and utter setback in what was possible programming-wise. So that the tools required where mainly chosen for their capability to perform well on underpowered hardware. This canalized the choice of tools for the decades to come.</p>
<p>Instead of Lisp and Smalltalk lower-level languages like COBOL, C and Pascal where needed to get acceptable performance out of the CPUs of low-cost-systems. Later the evolution of object-orientation for this environments continued on its own terms. And it seems: Not driven by the expert computer science researchers at the top of their field anymore, but by the requirements of cost effectiveness and stakeholder value. Strangely some of the seemingly big concepts developed over the years don&rsquo;t seem to add anything anymore to the <strong>ordering and design principles for program behavior to help reduce complexity.</strong> Instead they seem to wallow in the mire of self-induced complications. The field of object oriented software design seems contain some things that are mostly unnecessary when measured for their capability to add to maintainability, reliable and simplicity.</p>
<p>This is the first article in a series where I want to have a closer look at the aspects of object-orientation and what the big 3 concepts actually mean and that they&rsquo;re not cut in stone. Knowing how to replace them and why can help making smarter decisions in the field.</p>
